 # Asymptotic Limit
 
 In the context of computer science and mathematics refers to the behaviour of a function as its argument (or input) approches a specified value, often infinity. Im simpler terms, it's about understanding how function behaves when the input size becomes very large, without having to calculate the exact outcomes for those large values.
 
 When we talk about asymptotic limit in relation to algorithm analysis and Big O notation, we're usually interested in how the time complexity or space complexity of an algorithm changes as the size of the input (denoted as 𝓃) grows towards infinity.
 
 
This concept is crucial for several reasons:

### Comparing Algorithms
 
 It allow us ti compare the efficiency of different algorithms when the input size is large, which ofter the most critical factor in choosing between algorithms for practical application.
 
 
 ### Simplifying Complexity Analysis
 
 By focusing on the dominant term (the part of the function that increase the fastest as 𝓃 grows), we can simplify the complexity analysis. For instance, a function like 5𝓃² + 3𝓃 + 2 would be considered 𝑶(𝓃²) in Big O notation because as 𝓃 approaches infinity, the 𝓃² term grows much faster then the others, making them relatively insignificant.
 
 
 ### Predicting Scalability
 
 Understanding the asymptotic behaviour of an algorithm helps predict its scalability. For exemple, an algorithm with a time complexity of 𝑶(𝓃²) will likely become impractical for very large input sixes much faster then one with a complexity of 𝑶(𝓃 log 𝓃).

 
 ### To Conclude
 
 The asymptomatic limit is about examining and understanding the long-term behaviour of functions or algorithms as the input size becomes extremely large, providing a basis for analysing and comparing their efficiency and scalability.
