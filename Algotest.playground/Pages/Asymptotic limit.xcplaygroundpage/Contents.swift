 # Asymptotic limit
 
 In the context of computer science and mathematics refers to the behaviour of a function as its argument (or input) approches a specified value, often infinity. Im simpler terms, it's about understanding how function behaves when the input size becomes very large, without having to calculate the exact outcomes for those large values.
 
 When we talk about asymptotic limit in relation to algorithm analysis and Big O notation, we're usually interested in how the time complexity or space complexity of an algorithm changes as the size of the input (denoted as `n`) grows towards infinity.
 
 
This concept is crucial for several reasons:
